"Now we all know this is just another fantasy with hopeful thinking.... Biden is desperate to be pardoned from his sins but does he not know that the pope does not save a man only Jesus can do this!! This demented Biden has condoned the greatest atrocity of all time by allowing the murdering of innocent unborn babies. He has also left young men behind enemy lines to die with only a selfish motivations. He has also condemned innocent men, women and children to lives of poverty due to the unrelentless lies of this COVID-19 fiasco, taking livelihoods, health loss and death due to unverified and quickly released vaccines that do only harm and provide no solutions to the virus itself. This man was placed in a position to care for a nation of people and he has failed in every avenue intentionally because he has a personal agenda to single-handedly wreck this nation in order to bring on a socialist regime. He has gone against Godâ€™s people and itâ€™s persecuting them relentlessly which eventually will perpetuate and extend out into the world. If this pope is lying to the president about the way he is handling his affairs as a president then God help that pope as well because he is a liar. ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼",25,Long and descriptive but fallacious religious and political.

"I will not reveal my identity here but I have to state that you deserve what you are getting right now. As a younger man of age 14, 15, 16 and 17 in the 1980s, I was approached by men like you while they abused their positions of power as my employer in order to coerce me to have sex with them; when I did not relent they went so far as attempting to ram pens up my Rectum and surround me in semi-public areas and Gang-like atmosphere. Furthermore, I was approached by Gay Men/Pedophiles to make Gay/Pedophile Porn while still age 14, 15, 16 and 17. I am glad that you, Weinstein and the rest of you pieces of SHIT are being revealed for who you really are - this is the Hollywood of today.

As entertainers, women make less. Isn't that what JLaw was complaining about?",88,"Leading question, but overall non-toxic"
">Men and women are not payed less for the same job

I don't think many people say this is the case though. I think this is a misconception on the other side, not something feminists have said. Even if women have a lower ""average"" wage in all jobs than men... I mean that's even bigger than individual cases. This shows that women are in an inferior position *more* than if a woman were to get literally 30 cents less. Because averages show the bigger picture.

Edit: Changed 70 to 30.",76,"Touchy subject, but professionally explained"
"> All the wage gap is, is an average of total men's pay vs total women's pay. If you believe that's all it is, then sure.

So you admit it exists?

>When people refer to the pay gap, that ^ is what they are referring to most of the time.

"I think that Hollywood and professional sports are a big exception here, because salaries in those two industries have virtually no cap (and often aren't tied to the quality of work or quantity of work at all - they're about subjective ""star power"")",20,Wording and tone appear aggressive.
"> I don't think many people say this is the case though. I think this is a misconception on the other side, not something feminists have said.

"I don't think they're any different. They are the truest form of perceived value and scarcity of skill. 

It's the difference between the WNBA and NBA. 

There are many factors that could keep wages low for a woman. 

For instance, my wife took maternity leave for 6 weeks and her boss would hound her about missing our son or what her future plans were with our son. Her boss never asked if I were going to take time off, etc. the supposition was my wife was going to quit. My wife chose not to and after a year her boss finally let up. 

But if my wife did quit, somehow then that would be used to say WOMEN keep wages low themselves ignoring that women are often the go to for child rearing. ",34,Language is slightly chared
"> Women are a whole aren't just less interested in money than men are.

Source?

Mine is only anecdotal, but in my experience, factors *other than money* - schedules, flexibility, time off, work condition, work enjoyability, etc. - are much more important to women than they are to men.",84,"Generalizations, but admittedly so."
"The gist of my post was ""does it make sense to you? It conflicts with what we think/know of humankind."" So no source for that train of thought.",52,Nothing in language to provide much context on previous conversation's toxicity
"Biological differences cannot explain the trends we've seen in CS. Until about 1985, female enrollment in CS tracked up alongside other technical fields. Then it suddenly reversed and dropped dramatically. 

If the difference is biology, then what is going on here? Either there has been a dramatic change in women's biology since 1985 or there has been a dramatic change in CS (but not other technical fields) since 1985 that has not matched women's biology. Both of those are really suspect ideas, IMO.",88,Sets up a strawman argument and has a hint of sarcasm
"> It's the difference between the WNBA and NBA.

I'm not saying this isn't another can of worms entirely, but I've heard that this is primarily because the skill level of the players is not the same, the games are less exciting, and the stakes are lower. That feeds back on itself.",95,Comments use some primary facts and other opinions to draw generalizations without distinquishing them.
">The fact of the matter is, unless you want to strip young women of agency, and force them into high paying fields, and restrict them from having a family, there really is nothing that can be done about this difference in average earnings. Mainly, because it isn't a problem. There is no discrimination involved.

That isn't true. There is another way to reduce the differnce. Instead of stripping the agency of young women away, you could strip the agency of young men away. You could force them into low paying fields, and force them to take extra time off work whenever a female coworker has a kid.",24,Comments are sarcastic
"Well, if your wife quit in order to be a full time mother, doesn't that exactly mean that she chose to make less and therefore bring down the aggregate wage of all women? You have repeated the fact that women are generally the go to for child rearing but I don't see how that is relevant. You are free to quit your job and be a stay at home dad and let your wife continue her career. There is no inherent reason women should continue to be the primary caregivers and I don't see why any parent should be given special consideration by an employer and paid more or offered promotions just because they had kids and chose to spend less effort and time on work. ",90,Sarcastic tone and agreesive toward real-world experiences
Women have not spent years being told that their value as human beings is tied to the money they bring in. It would honestly surprise me a lot if women cared as much about pay as men do.,11,Comment is more of a musing
"Doesn't it also mean the husband choose for his wife to earn less? If a husband and wife want a stay at home parent and decide together in mutual agreement for the wife to quit her job, then the choice for the woman to earn less rests equally on both man and woman in that situation. So we can't just say it's all women making these choices; men contribute to the choices as well.",11,"Point made without emotional charged language, although idea might be charged"
"So you do believe socialization plays a huge role in people's choices, and you do acknowledge that in the past women weren't socialized to be as career focused as men, so it seems to me like  you'd understand how the explanations of why the wage gap exists are not justifications and that it stems from outdated gender roles conditioning that should be eradicated.",50,Difficult to understand the tone or context surrounding this comment. Could be very toxic or in agreement with something the other party previously said
"Absolutely. But ""socialization"" is not a monolith. ""Women are discouraged from lucrative careers"" and ""men are willing to sacrifice more for their careers because they are judged more harshly on them"" both goes under socialization, but they're extremely different explanations. I don't think there's anyone outside a small minority that argues that socialization plays no role at all.",48,Balanced language. A number of charged qualifiers
OP is arguing that. Or at least that it's not a problem.,97,"Opinion is stated, but not without concession of uncertainty"
"No. OP is arguing that the difference in incomes is not due to discrimination. Which is probably not completely true, but mostly true (maybe 1/5th of the difference being discrimination).",60,Language is clear without seeming aggressive due to consession given.
Maybe it could have something to do with the recent trend of feminists saying computer science is sexist. Who would want to join a profession that would treat them as less. Even if there is no sexism the perception could keep people away.,39,Charged language with question that could be seen as aggressive
So you agree that its not a biological difference.,7,The word 'so' makes this seem like a contentious question
"> Is it possible that new developments in particular fields led women away?

You tell me. We'd need to see a massive shift in the field to explain this. Both my parents were software engineers and I'm a CS PhD. In my opinion, there was no sea change in the 80s in terms of the actual work done by computer scientists and software engineers that justifies a massive change in trends among women in CS. 

You are right that the stats I gave do not necessarily indicate sexism. But they do indicate that the ""men and women are just different"" justification is extremely loose. Even if women aren't discouraged by intentional sexism, culture can still play a big role. A lot of people feel that these cultural forces are a problem. ",20,"Sentences seem explanatory, but extremely loose could be seen as aggressive"
"There is a culture of exclusion in many higher paying fields like tech and science wherein women don't feel like they belong, are equals, etc. to men. And so some elect to enter another field after experiencing this directly, whereas others opt never to enter such fields in the first place and take up lesser paying jobs. 

Sociological forces are at play, is my point. Also, the burden of children is something you shouldn't neglect. There are all sorts of reasons why a child came unplanned into her life, something which had a detrimental impact on her potential job earnings. And if you count the total number of caloric hours of labor undertaken by men and women, women work between 20 to 30 percent more per week than men, on average. Because, yes, child care and home making is labor, albeit unpaid. ",10,Sarcastic tone with an aggressive tone in the last two sentences.
"Because it's what commonly happens. There's what can and what is. 

What is is getting better, but we still have work to do. ",40,Short sentences with a slight air of condescension
"But what is the work that needs done exactly? That is I believe the point of contention. If you say we just need to advocate for cultural shifts, I agree. That is hard to do and not really the purview of the government. If you want specific government action, what specifically would that be? Another equal pay law isn't going to solve anything. ",24,Condescending tone
">Doesn't it also mean the husband choose for his wife to earn less? If a husband and wife want a stay at home parent and decide together in mutual agreement for the wife to quit her job, then the choice for the woman to earn less rests equally on both man and woman in that situation.

Generally, couples opt for one partner to stay home and care for the kids because daycare is *expensive*. For babies, it can be $25,000/year expensive. If you make $40,000/year, that's basically your take-home after taxes. So, unless both partners are high wage earners, it usually makes more economic sense for one to stay home. No one wants to work a full-time job just to pay for someone else to take care of their child.",50,Figures are used with netural language
"So what do you make of that fact that many other countries have much lower aggregate wage gaps than the U.S.? Do they have ""biologically different women""?

">i cannot think of anything which cannot be proven through the scientific method in which i believe.

How would you go about proving that claim, which you apparently believe, through the scientific method?

How do you measure belief? How do you show that it is the ""I"" that is doing the believing and not some other thing?  How do you, scientifically, show the existence of the ""I"" at all? And having crossed those hurdles, how do you determine that each of your beliefs are scientifically provable?  Is that even possible? Most people have an infinite number of beliefs, how can you confirm, scientifically, that each of your infinite beliefs is scientifically provable?",95,Questions are asked in a professional way
"There are six arguments that I believe make the existence of God more likely (there are far more, the six are just the most well known).

"Do you have any affirmative evidence for God?

Or is this simply you showing a great deal of conformation bias. 

If I stripped the Bible from existence, would you still believe in the Judeo/Christian God?

Just saying that these x arguments mean that God is possible doesn't mean that God as you know him does exist. It just means that it is possible. 
",10,Question is asked with a very accusatory tone
"In my post I listed several arguments for the existence of God. 

The arguments I gave also do not end with ""Therefore God is possible."" They end with variants of ""Therefore God exists."" If you accept the premises then the conclusion necessarily follows. Some may not seem as obvious (such as the Kalam) but when parsed out leads to a powerful, immaterial, personal cause that exists outside of time and space. 

The argument for the resurrection uses the Bible but I don't assume that the Bible is the word of God or even accurate when I use it. I treat it as a historical document and use principals found in Bayesian probability theory to make the case for the most likely explanation.

"there is a difference between a belief and actual existence. People can believe in purple bunnies, that does not mean they exist.

"Once you make an affirmative claim like you just did: GOD EXISTS..


Now you have the small problem of showing evidence for that claim. And you have none. 

you are starting with a conclusion already in mind and then matching things to meet that conclusion which means that you are swimming in confirmation bias. You are just keeping what you like and getting rid of what doesn't mean your final conclusion. 

you make any claims that you want. They just are useless without evidence. 

Can't you see that anything you can do to prove my God, I can do to ""prove"" the the invisible flying dragon I just made up.

"Evidence is used in the premise of a syllogism.

"I'm not the person you're responding to.  That said....

In order to have a rational discourse, a few presuppositions have to be made concerning the nature of reality.  Two that come to mind : Reality exists, and our senses are giving us a reliable view of that reality.  

We employ the information provided by our senses to understand reality and survive in it.  The scientific method is just an extention of that.  The only way to deny or question it is to start questioning our perception of reality, which makes rational discourse impossible.",93,Professionally stated thoughts
But a materialistic view as expressed through natural selection can directly bring those senses into question. If reason leads us to natural selection and natural selection leads back to a lack of confidence in our reason then the view self-destructs. ,91,Professionally stated thoughts
">The only way to deny or question it is to start questioning our perception of reality, which makes rational discourse impossible. 

Descartes would disagree.

The scientific method is inductive reasoning, and we can rule that out and still be left with deductive reasoning.  Rational discourse is entirely possible when limited to deduction.  

In fact, given that there is no non-circular argument for induction, one might argue that inductive reasoning is inherently irrational.  ",91,Slightly condescending by introducing expert outside material
"That's a perfectly valid criticism to make.  But I would argue that going that route renders the entire argument meaningless.  If you're going to question your ability to perceive reality, then you can't justify any knowledge or beliefs you have concerning reality.

So while it is reasonable to suspect one's senses for the purpose of a philosophical debate, it isn't really meaningful outside of that context.  In reality, you rely on your senses to survive.  And you employ a form of the scientific method in order to do so.",88,Professionally stated thoughts

">I define God as the greatest conceivable being.

This can actually be proof that that God doesn't exist. I can prove this through the sheer power of numbers. Greatest implies a sense of quantity. If we posited any being that we might call God, who took up any infinite amount of space (just for one possible value of ""greatest"") then I can conceive a larger infinity that that being could fill, thus making that God fall short of that standard. Anything that is quantifiable, I can conceive of something larger than what actually exists, just by adding 1 to it.

So, if we're arguing that God, I can say that any being will fall short of that because of the nature of infinities and the infinite number of infinities and some infinities being larger than other infinities.",48,Neutral language but in context could be seen as a challenge

This statement shows failure to understand the scientific method. AccordIng to the scientific method in order to say ""X does not exist"" X must be falsified.
