        "# ⛓️ Chains in Langchain\n",
        "\n",
        "In Langchain, **Chains** are powerful, reusable components that can be linked together to perform complex tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Chains can be formed using various types of components, such as:\n",
        " - prompts,\n",
        " - models,\n",
        " - arbitrary functions,\n",
        " - or even other chains\n",
        "\n",
        "🔄 Chains allow you to combine language models with other data sources and third-party APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few examples of the diverse types of Chains you can create in Langchain:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **LLM Chain**: The most common chain. Takes an input, formats it, and passes it to an LLM for processing. Basic components are PromptTemplate, an LLM, and an optional output parser.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Sequential Chain**: A series of Chains executed in a specific order. There are different variations, including:\n",
        "- SimpleSequentialChain - singular input/output with output of one step as input to the next\n",
        "- SequentialChain - allows for multiple inputs/outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Index Chains**: These combine your data stored in indexes with LLMs. Useful for question answering over your own documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **BashChain**: A specialized chain for running filesystem commands.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **LLM Math**: Designed to solve complex word math problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 🖊️ Prompts in Langchain: A Quick Guide\n",
        "\n",
        "In Langchain, **Prompts** guide the responses of Language Models (LLMs).\n",
        "\n",
        "## 📝 Prompt Template\n",
        "\n",
        "A **Prompt Template** is not just a static question or instruction, but rather a dynamic and adaptable way to generate a prompt for the LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "It's a string that takes multiple inputs and generate a structured prompt tailored for those inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt Templates may also contain specific instructions for the LLM, a set of \"few-shot\" examples to help guide the LLM's response, and possibly a direct question to be answered by the LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt Templates simplify the process of managing complex or varied inputs, and can make your code cleaner and more maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "📚 For more information on Chains and Prompt Templates, you can refer to the extensive [Langchain documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/)!\n"
