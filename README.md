## Hi there 👋 We on a mission to build tools that actually track impact, not just measuring vanity metrics that your boss wants to hold over you. 

There is truly no limit to we can build, with a special focus on building a platform that is:
1. trustworthy (we are building with the community, not trying to monitize the community's data)
2. decentralized (someone else shouldn't be able to control your data)
3. merit-based (we strongly believe people should be compensated for the value they create)

## What is Perspect?
Developers crave challenges and meaningful recognition for the work they undertake. Perspect recognizes this inherent desire and transforms every task tackled, every line of code written, and every innovative solution developed into significant achievements. It acknowledges their hard work and talent, fostering a profound sense of accomplishment and ownership.

Perspect shifts the focus from conventional, top-down tools designed primarily for managers and businesses, to an individual-centric platform. Ultimately, Perspect is built for individuals. This radical shift puts the power of validation in the hands of those who create and contribute, enhancing autonomy and trust.

With Perspect, each developer is a significant player in their narrative and the broader journey towards a decentralized future. Their actions and contributions aren't just steps in their personal growth, but integral parts of a larger transformative picture. Perspect is more than a tool—it's a revolution, a celebration of the individual's power to create, innovate, and leave a lasting impact.
